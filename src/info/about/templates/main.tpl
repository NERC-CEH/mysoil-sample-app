    <p>The iRecord Soil App has been developed for recording information in the
      field as soil samples are taken. It is aimed at the agricultural industry
      where, in the UK alone, over half a million samples are taken annually. It
      replaces the use of paper forms and, importantly, adds a precise geolocation
      to the data collected.
     </p>
     <p>The aim is to create 'smart soil data' where the results of soil sampling
       become digital, discoverable, precisely located, with an accredited laboratory
       analysis. By doing this, we can begin to address questions such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Why have we reached a yield plateau?</li>
      <li>Why does yield decline follow crop rotation?</li>
      <li>Is soil carbon stock declining?</li>
    </ul>  
  </li>
