    <p>iRecordSoil App is an application that enables you to get involved in soil recording. 
      You can contribute your sightings with photos, GPS acquired coordinates, descriptions 
      and other information, thus providing you with an online digital record of the soil 
      health on your land. In addition, by contributing to the service you enable researchers 
      to use information to produce research that will advance UK farming and produce free 
      to view derived products such as national maps of soil properties like soil pH. This 
      contributes to the understanding of soil health, planning, research and education.
